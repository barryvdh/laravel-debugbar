# Usage

## Using the Debugbar

When the Debugbar is enabled, the Debugbar is shown on the bottom of the screen, similar to the documentation preview.

Based on your configuration, it shows the [Collectors](collectors.md) for the current request. You can open, close, restore or minimize the toolbar for your need. The state will be remembered.

## Debugbar Facade
You can now add messages using the Facade (when added), using the PSR-3 levels (debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency):

```php
Debugbar::info($object);
Debugbar::error('Error!');
Debugbar::warning('Watch out…');
Debugbar::addMessage('Another message', 'mylabel');
```

And start/stop timing:

```php
Debugbar::startMeasure('render','Time for rendering');
Debugbar::stopMeasure('render');
Debugbar::addMeasure('now', LARAVEL_START, microtime(true));
Debugbar::measure('My long operation', function() {
    // Do something…
});
```

Or log exceptions:

```php
try {
    throw new Exception('foobar');
} catch (Exception $e) {
    Debugbar::addThrowable($e);
}
```

## Helpers

There are also helper functions available for the most common calls:

```php
// All arguments will be dumped as a debug message
debug($var1, $someString, $intValue, $object);

// `$collection->debug()` will return the collection and dump it as a debug message. Like `$collection->dump()`
collect([$var1, $someString])->debug();

start_measure('render','Time for rendering');
stop_measure('render');
add_measure('now', LARAVEL_START, microtime(true));
measure('My long operation', function() {
    // Do something…
});
```

If you want you can add your own DataCollectors, through the Container or the Facade:

```php
Debugbar::addCollector(new DebugBar\DataCollector\MessagesCollector('my_messages'));
//Or via the App container:
$debugbar = App::make('debugbar');
$debugbar->addCollector(new DebugBar\DataCollector\MessagesCollector('my_messages'));
```

## Enabling/Disabling on run time
You can enable or disable the debugbar during run time.

```php
debugbar()->enable();
debugbar()->disable();
```

NB. Once enabled, the collectors are added (and could produce extra overhead), so if you want to use the debugbar in production, disable in the config and only enable when needed.

## Console

When using Console Commands, you can log data to the Debugbar by manually enabling the debugbar. You can then view the data by browsing the Debugbar requests in the UI.

```php
debugber()->enable();

```



## Storage

Debugbar remembers previous requests, which you can view using the Browse button on the right. This will only work if you enable `debugbar.storage.open` in the config.
Make sure you only do this on local development, because otherwise other people will be able to view previous requests.
In general, Debugbar should only be used locally or at least restricted by IP.
It's possible to pass a callback, which will receive the Request object, so you can determine access to the OpenHandler storage.

## Twig Integration

Laravel Debugbar comes with two Twig Extensions. These are tested with [rcrowe/TwigBridge](https://github.com/rcrowe/TwigBridge) 0.6.x

Add the following extensions to your TwigBridge config/extensions.php (or register the extensions manually)

```php
'Fruitcake\LaravelDebugbar\Twig\Extension\Debug',
'Fruitcake\LaravelDebugbar\Twig\Extension\Dump',
'Fruitcake\LaravelDebugbar\Twig\Extension\Stopwatch',
```

The Dump extension will replace the [dump function](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/functions/dump.html) to output variables using the DataFormatter. The Debug extension adds a `debug()` function which passes variables to the Message Collector,
instead of showing it directly in the template. It dumps the arguments, or when empty; all context variables.

```twig
{{ debug() }}
{{ debug(user, categories) }}
```

The Stopwatch extension adds a [stopwatch tag](http://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-2-4-a-stopwatch-tag-for-twig)  similar to the one in Symfony/Silex Twigbridge.

```twig
{% stopwatch "foo" %}
    …some things that gets timed
{% endstopwatch %}
```
